# Documentation

Here you will find **Usage** and **Dev-Oriented** Documentation.

## What Kind of Documentation?
- Basic Usage  
*Like: Installing; How to Configure...*
- Problem Solving  
*Possible Usage Issues and Solutions.*
- Changelogs, maybe?  
*Dunno if its will be a thing since theyre already on releases.*
- Abstract Diagrams  
*General Structure.*
- Detailed Diagrams  
*All the relations and values.*

Can't think more in this moment...

*Note: This folder will not contain all the documentation since all READMEs and in-code comments also make part of the project documentation*
